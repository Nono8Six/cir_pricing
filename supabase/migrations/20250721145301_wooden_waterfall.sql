  # Fix clients RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies on clients table
    - Create simple policies that allow all authenticated users to manage clients
    - This resolves the "new row violates row-level security policy" error

  2. New Policies
    - Allow all authenticated users to read clients
    - Allow all authenticated users to insert clients
    - Allow all authenticated users to update clients
    - Allow all authenticated users to delete clients
