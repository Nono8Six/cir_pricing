/*
  # Fix groups RLS policies

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive policies
    - Create simple policies that work with authenticated users
    - Allow all authenticated users to manage groups (can be restricted later)

  2. Notes
    - Removes dependency on profiles table for groups operations
    - Ensures groups functionality works immediately
    - Can be made more restrictive once user roles are properly set up
